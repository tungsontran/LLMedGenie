    "transcription": "Patient is a 72-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with dyspnea and orthopnea. On physical exam, the patient is in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure is elevated at 12 cm of H2O. His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion, but he demonstrates bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. His cardiac exam is significant for a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen is benign. His extremities show 2+ pitting edema. His neurologic exam is unremarkable. His laboratory studies are significant for a BNP of 160 pg/mL. His chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His ECG shows sinus rhythm with a left ventricular hypertrophy pattern. His echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic dysfunction. The patient is diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",

    "transcription": "Patient presents with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient is a 65-year-old male, a smoker with a 40 pack-year history. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed 5 years ago. The patient reports worsening dyspnea on exertion and increased frequency of chest pain over the past 2 months. Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lung fields. Laboratory studies include a white blood cell count of 9.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, and a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 42 mm Hg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 58 mm Hg on room air. Chest x-ray reveals hyperinflation and bilateral upper lobe infiltrates. Pulmonary function tests reveal a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 50% and a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 60%. Echocardiogram reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF. Cardiac catheterization reveals 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery and 70% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Coronary angiography confirms the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is made. Treatment with bronchodilators and statins is initiated.",
