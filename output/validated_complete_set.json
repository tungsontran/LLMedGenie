The decision is made to proceed with cholecystectomy. The patient is taken to the operating room and anesthesia is administered. A midline incision is made and the abdomen is insufflated with air. The gallbladder is identified and a T-tube is placed. The gallbladder is then dissected free from the liver bed and the cystic duct and artery are clipped and divided. The gallbladder is removed and the bed is inspected for any bleeding. The incision is closed in layers with absorbable sutures. The patient is monitored post-operatively and discharged on post-operative day 3.",

Pre-operative evaluation included digital rectal exam (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and urinalysis (UA). DRE revealed a large, firm prostate with a palpable median lobe. PSA level was within normal limits. UA showed no evidence of infection. The patient was scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with monopolar electrocautery. The procedure began with the placement of a Foley catheter and the administration of prophylactic antibiotics. The patient was placed in the lithotomy position and sterile prep was performed. A 22-Fr. Foley catheter was inserted and 200 mL of urine was drained. The catheter was removed and the prostate gland was visualized using a 20-Fr. Cystoscope. The median lobe was dissected and removed using monopolar electrocautery. The remaining adenoma was resected in a piecemeal fashion. The specimen weighed 45 g. Hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery and the bladder neck was reconstructed. The Foley catheter was replaced and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Post-operative care included strict intake of fluids, monitoring of urine output, and pain management. The patient was discharged on post-operative day 2 with a Foley catheter in place and scheduled for catheter removal in 1 week.",

Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is also elevated. This can be a sign of a hematologic malignancy. Patient: Hematologic malignancy? That sounds serious. Doctor: Yes, it's a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In your case, we'll need to do a bone marrow biopsy to confirm our suspicions. Once we have that result, we can discuss treatment options with you. Patient: Okay. Doctor: The biopsy revealed that you have multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. We'll need to initiate treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Patient: What kind of chemotherapy and immunotherapy will I be getting? Doctor: We'll start with a regimen called bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone.

Review of systems is otherwise negative. Physical exam is significant for some tenderness to palpation over her metacarpophalangeal joints and metatarsophalangeal joints bilaterally. She has some swelling and stiffness in these joints, but no deformity. Her range of motion is full. Her hands and feet are warm and erythematous. Labs show a mildly elevated ESR of 21 and a mildly elevated CRP of 4. Her rheumatoid factor is negative. X-rays of the hands show erosions and joint space narrowing. Her chest x-ray is unremarkable. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone and serum protein electrophoresis are within normal limits. She is up to date on her immunizations, including pneumococcal, influenza, and tdap. She denies any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Her family history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. Her mother is doing well on methotrexate.
