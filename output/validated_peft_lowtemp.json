The patient's heart is regular in rhythm and without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient's abdomen is benign. The patient's extremities are without edema. The patient's neurologic examination is benign. Laboratory studies are significant for a hemoglobin A1C of 7.2%. A chest X-ray is significant for bibasilar opacities. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is significant for a left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) pattern. A complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and lipid panel are within normal limits. The patient's echocardiogram reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) reveal a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 50% and a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 60%.
