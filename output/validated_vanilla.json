The right ventricle end-diastolic dimension is 3.7 centimeters. The left ventricle end-systolic dimension is 4.1 centimeters. The right ventricle end-systolic dimension is 2.9 centimeters. The left atrium volume index is 110 milliliters per meter squared. The right atrium volume index is 120 milliliters per meter squared. The left ventricle mass index is 138 grams per meter squared. The left ventricle myocardial performance index is 0.45. The right ventricle myocardial performance index is 0.22. The left ventricle global longitudinal strain is -12.8%. The right ventricle global longitudinal strain is -19.3%. The patient was diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.",

    "transcription": "Patient presents to the clinic today with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient reports that the symptoms began approximately one week ago and have persisted since that time. The patient denies any other symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, or fever. The patient reports a history of smoking, having quit approximately 10 years ago. The patient reports that he has been followed in the pulmonary clinic for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's most recent pulmonary function testing was performed approximately 6 months ago and revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 50% of predicted. The patient reports that his symptoms have been worsening over the past several months, and that he has required the use of his rescue inhaler more frequently. The patient reports that he has not been taking his inhalers as prescribed due to cost. The patient reports that he has been following a low sodium diet and denies any other significant medical history. The patient's medications include albuterol, ipratropium, and salmeterol inhalers as needed, and atenolol 50 mg daily. The patient's vital signs are stable and within normal limits. On exam, the patient is in no acute distress. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. The patient's heart is without murmur. The patient's extremities are without edema. The patient's abdomen is benign. The patient's neurologic exam is normal. Based on the patient's history and examination, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is made. The patient is prescribed bronchodilators as needed and statins to manage his cardiac risk factors.",
